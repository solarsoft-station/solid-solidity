# Gas consumption

In the Ethereum blockchain, every contract deployment and transaction consumes gas. The gas is paid in ether and has an economic value. When you deploy a contract, the compiled code is sent to the blockchain. The bigger the contract code is, the more gas units it consumes when deployed. It is recommended that the contract should be compiled with optimization flag enabled. Enabling optimization might optimize the code size and consume less gas units when deployed. Sometimes, the optimized contract also consumes less gas units when their function is called.
